 Two automatic weather stations (AWS) were mounted in the skiing area of Patscherkofel on 23rd of 
 March 2018 to investigate whether artificial snow has an impact on the change of reflectivity of 
shortwave radiation and consequently an impact on the surface energy budget. For this purpose two CNR4 Net 
 Radiometer were installed, which measure the incoming and outgoing longwave and shortwave radiation. 
First, both were placed in natural terrain on snow next to a ski slope. On the 6th of April 2018, 
one station was moved onto the ski slope. The measurement period was from 23rd of March until the 9th 
 of May. It has to be mentioned that there was a huge amount of natural snow in this winter and we do 
 not know how much artificial snow actually was produced, so it is hard to quantify how strong the 
 effect actually is.
 
 ## Quality check of the Data and Methods
 
 Due to some battery problems the examination of the data starts with the 28th of March. In figure 1 
 the incoming and outgoing shortwave radiation of both stations are plotted. The shortwave radiation 
 follows the typical daily course we would expect. For every time step the albedo was calculated by 
 dividing the outgoing by the incoming shortwave radiation. Some albedo values were higher than 1 which 
is physically impossible. One source of error are disturbances of the upper sensor, which was sometimes 
covered by snow. Additionally, the lower sensor receives more shortwave radiation in the morning when 
the sun has a low elevation angle and radiates directly into the lower sensor. These values are excluded from our analysis. As these 
 instant albedo calculations for each data point are very sensitive to measurement errors, e.g. extreme
 peak by a single measurement, it is better to analyse the daily albedo. For the following it was 
 calculated by summing the outgoing and incoming radiation over each day and dividing these two 
quantities by each other.

 ## Results
 
Figure 2 shows the daily albedo of both stations for the measurement period. As we can see, the albedo
 exceeds 0.7 until the 1st of April, then metamorphosis changes the properties of the snow and the albedo 
 decreases to values between 0.55 and 0.7 for a period of 15 days. The variations in this time span can be
 explained by the change between new snowfall (4th, 8th and 12th of April), which leads to higher albedos,
and warm temperatures that induce transformation processes in the snow.  When melting occurs, a layer of 
 water covers the snow, which has a lower albedo than snow. (Mote, 2008) Afterwards, from 16th of April on,
 the albedo decreases continuously until the snow is completely melted. A period of hot days in 
 comparison to the days before started. The albedo reaches values below 0.2, which belong to snow-free 
surfaces (according to the analysis of the Neustift data described in (LINK to Neustift article #####)). The photos of the 
 dismounting show a muddy surface for Patscherkofel 1 and pasture for Patscherkofel 2.

 Until the 5th of April the albedo of both stations is nearly identical. With the relocation of Patscherkofel 2 
 on 6th of April they start to differ. This could be explained by the expected differences of the snow 
 properties (artificial snow vs. natural snow), which is supported by the fact that both station show the 
 same albedo at the 9th of April after a large snowfall. This day can be seen as a reset where both stations 
 start again under the same conditions. They begin to differ directly after it. Different properties could be
 the snow grain size or transmittance. Mote (2008) describes that a larger grain size leads to a higher 
 albedo. Since we did not measure these quantities, we cannot evaluate their influence.  However also possible
 technical problems have to be considered, which could occur due to the relocation, as well as differences 
 between the sites. The station that is located on the ski slope reaches its minimum albedo two days later than
 the other one. There are a few aspects to be taken into account. The snow on the ski slope should be denser
 due to the skiers that compress it, and in addition due to the heavy snowcats that distribute extra artificial
 snow on it. So the decrease of the snow height by melting is expected to be slower compared to the natural
 site since more energy per square meter is needed to melt the same height of the snow. There
 were also a few skiers in the area of natural snow, but their impact is considered to be little. Further the
 albedo is lower on Patscherkofel 1 (natural site), therefore more energy is absorbed by the snow, which is 
 used to melt it faster. Unfortunately the stations were installed on different types of grounds. The station
 on the ski slope was placed on a pasture whereas the other one stood very close to a small stream, where the
 ground was wet and muddy. The darker muddy ground of Patscherkofel 1 has a lower albedo (0.1) than green 
 pasture on Patscherkofel 2 (0.2). Brock et al. (2000) explains that the underlying albedo influences the 
 snow albedo when the snow height is below 0.5 cm w.e. . Therefore the melting at Patscherkofel 1 should be 
 faster since its underlying albedo is lower. We cannot prove this assumption, because we do not know the 
 development of the snow heights. Moreover it has to be thought about the fact that with the flowing of 
 the river a melt process from underneath the station could have taken place. We are not 
 able to know the degree of the influence on the overall melting process. But this could be another reason for 
 Patscherkofel 1 being snow-free 2 days earlier.
 
 The transition zone between snow covered and snow-free ground is easy to identify in our case, since there 
 did not occur snowfall events after the complete melting of the snow. This process was fast and without 
 interruptions.
 
 ## Conclusion
 
 With our measurement we detected a difference in the behavior of natural and artificial snow. On the one hand 
 the ski slope’s snow showed a slightly higher albedo until the continuous melting period started on 16th of 
April (between 1 % to 11 %). On the other hand, the site of natural snow was snow-free sooner, but this 
 difference is only two days. Probably, this is due to the lower albedo value at the beginning of the 
 continuous melting period. 
 
 The main problem is, that we do not know the mixing ratio of natural and artificial snow on the ski slopes, 
and therefore an evalutation of the influence of artificial snow on the energy budget is impossible. A winter with 
 less snow would be easier for the analysis. Further the differences of the snow properties are not clear, 
 besides the density that should be higher on the ski slope as explained before. But according to Brock et 
 al. (2000) the density should not have a significant impact on the albedo. In addition, the measurements 
 are only point measurements. It has to be considered that there are differences in the sites, which are 
 due to amount and number of snowfall, aspect, cloudiness and shadowing. 
 
 In further work it would be important to use also sites where the artificial snow stays significantly longer 
 than the natural. At least the snow height of both stations and a density profile at the relocation date 
 should have been measured. Then it could be determined whether the delay in the melt process is due to 
 the albedo, the density or the different snow heights.
